/* ── DashboardQueue ──
   A row of queue-type summary widgets — e.g. "Digital" / "Inbound Voice" /
   "Voicemail" / "Work Item" on a contact center home screen, each showing
   how many Contacts and Agents (cards) or Skills and Contacts (accordion —
   see below) are queued. Two interchangeable layouts, same `items` data,
   picked with `variant`:

   1. "cards" (default) — each queue renders as its own standalone
      `DashboardCard` (a "hero" `Icon` for the queue's own type — Digital,
      Inbound Voice, Voicemail, Work Item, etc. — + name + "Wait Time:
      {wait}" header, Contacts/Agents as "divided" metrics — plain columns
      separated by a vertical rule, not boxed) — no shared enclosing
      backdrop; each card carries its own `neutral-subtle` surface.
      "divided" (rather than "contained") was picked specifically for this
      row: with 4+ queues on screen at once, the per-metric boxes'
      padding was the single biggest driver of each card's height, and
      this widget is meant to be scanned at a glance, not read closely —
      dropping the boxes measurably shrinks every card without losing
      either number. Laid
      out via `.lyra-container-grid-wrap`/`.lyra-container-grid` (see
      lyra-tokens.css) — the same CSS container-query pattern the home
      tab's Activity/Performance/Productivity row uses — so this row
      collapses to a stacked column once its own available width gets
      tight, same as that one, rather than staying a fixed N-column grid
      that squeezes its cards (and their metric numbers/labels) into an
      unreadably narrow space. Because that layout is a flex row of equal-
      width items (not a fixed-count grid), a 5th (or 6th) queue just
      joins the same row and everyone gets a little narrower, right up
      until the container-query thresholds above kick in — nothing about
      the row itself needs to know how many queues it's holding. Clicking
      a card selects it (`selectedId`/`onSelect`, controlled/uncontrolled
      like `FilterChip`'s own selection prop) — the selected card gets the
      `info-strong` (blue) `Container` treatment instead. Built for a
      click-to-drill-down pattern (e.g. opening a side panel with that
      queue's own sub-queues), but `DashboardQueue` itself only reports
      the selection; anything opened as a result of it is the consumer's
      concern, not this component's.
   2. "accordion" — the same queue list as expandable `Accordion` rows
      instead of a card grid: icon + name + "{contactsCount} contacts in
      queue" / "Wait: {wait}" subhead, with the Skills/Contacts metrics
      moved into the row's `endSlot` (same `Container` + `Metric`
      composition as the "cards" variant uses, just smaller and inline).
      Each item's optional `content` becomes what's shown when its row
      expands — e.g. a table of that queue's individual interactions.

   Both variants compose existing atoms (`DashboardCard`/`Metric`,
   `Accordion`, `Container`) rather than re-deriving card/row markup, per
   "composition over reimplementation." See the "QueueCards" and
   "QueueAccordion" stories, each modeled on a specific reference
   screenshot. */
